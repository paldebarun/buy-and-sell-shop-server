# buy-and-sell-shop-server
this is an express js server of a buy-and-sell shop to buy and sell different product and items here I used express js framework to create the app and mongoose to connect the execute the essential iperations of mongodb database and an additional feature of creating otp and verifying the essential rendering through this using the nodemailer package. The obstructions that were created while executing the code was firstly at nodeailer functioning because on the calling the api to sent the otp through mail , it was showing an error , so I searched the internet and read documenteries to know the reasons and the reason I found was that I had put the wront credentials of the transporter module of nodemailer package so i went to my gmail and created an app password for my server and then the nodemailer was functioning properly. so the next obstruction which I faced during the execution of the code was a very silly mistake in which I was verifying that whether the otp created was being previously created by matching it with the documents of the otp schema in mongodb and during this created a very silly mistake I wrongly mentioned the name of the otp paramter of the otp schema that is actually we are going to compare and match, so it took me a long to grab that mistake ut at the end I git the gap and filled it. Now the server is running well.
